CocoaHedron
===========
This screen saver draws two interlocked recursive tetrahedrons. 
Each recursive tetrahedron contains four smaller recursive tetrahedrons at its edges. 
The relative size, distance and rotation of the descendants changes according to a 
sine function, the parameters of which can be set interactively.
